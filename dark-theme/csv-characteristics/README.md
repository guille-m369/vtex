- Show a table of specifications with the `csv-characteristics` interface

## Configuration

1. Add the app as a dependency in your store theme

```
"store-them.csv-characteristics": "0.x"
```

2. Declare the app block in your store inside the product page

```
{
   ...
   "children":[
      "csv-characteristics"
   ]
}
```

```
{
   ...
   "children":[
      "custom-product-description"
   ]
}
```

Note: For this to work from the catalog, the text of the description with separators must be put in the product description attribute
This separator to separate the description and the specifications: "%-!-%!"
and this to indicate newlines: "|"
Also in the characteristics part separate by commas as a csv file.
